This repository is packed with well coded HTML forms like the sign up, sign in pages and tables meant for user input and data presentation. The forms contain varieties of different input types, and the tables organize and display data in a clear manner. The elements has been styled using CSS for improved appearance and usability. This project is providing me a good foundation for building responsive and user-friendly web applications.
